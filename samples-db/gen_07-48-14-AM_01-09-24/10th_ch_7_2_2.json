      "context": "The sperms formed are delivered through the vas deferens which unites with a tube coming from the urinary bladder.",

      "context": "Along the path of the vas deferens, glands like the prostate and the seminal vesicles add their secretions so that the sperms are now in a fluid which makes their transport easier.",
