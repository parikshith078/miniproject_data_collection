      "context": "Since the food and the way it is obtained differs, the digestive system is different in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food may be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialised to perform different functions.",

      "context": "For example, Amoeba takes in food using temporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming a food-vacuole. Inside the food-vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm.",
