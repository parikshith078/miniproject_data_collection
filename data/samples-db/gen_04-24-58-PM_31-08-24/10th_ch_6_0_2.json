      "context": "Reflex actions are responses to stimuli that occur without conscious thought, allowing for rapid reactions to danger. An example is pulling your hand back from a flame immediately upon contact, without taking time to think. This quick response is facilitated by reflex arcs that bypass the brain's slower processing to prevent injury.",
      "question": "What is a reflex action?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Reflex arcs are formed in the spinal cord, where sensory nerves connect directly to motor nerves. This arrangement allows for quicker responses to danger because it minimizes the delay caused by having to process information in the brain. The brain still receives the information but only after the reflex action occurs.",
      "question": "Where are reflex arcs formed?"
    },
    {
      "context": "In reflex actions, sensory nerves that detect heat connect directly to motor nerves that move muscles, bypassing the brain for faster response times. This connection is crucial in urgent situations where speed is necessary to avoid injury, illustrating how evolution has shaped these rapid responses in animals.",
      "question": "Why are reflex arcs important?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Touching a hot object triggers a reflex action wherein the sensory neurons send signals directly to the spinal cord. Instead of the signals traveling to the brain first, the spinal cord processes this information swiftly, causing an immediate response to withdraw from the danger without delay.",
      "question": "How does the spinal cord aid in reflex actions?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Reflex actions occur automatically, allowing us to react without conscious thought. These responses involve a simple neural pathway that includes sensory neurons that detect stimuli and motor neurons that execute the response, making reflexes quick and efficient in preventing harm.",
      "question": "What role do sensory neurons play in reflexes?"
