      "context": "As chemicals from pesticides accumulate in plants, they are absorbed by aquatic life too. This leads to higher concentrations at each trophic level due to their non-degradable nature.",

      "context": "These chemicals are taken up by aquatic plants and animals, leading to an accumulation in the food chain as they are not readily broken down or degraded in the environment.",
