      "context": "For example, a hormone called auxin, synthesized at the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot, stimulating the cells to grow longer on that side and causing the plant to bend towards light.",
