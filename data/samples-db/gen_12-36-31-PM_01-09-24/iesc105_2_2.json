      "context": "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane coverings. The outer membrane is porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded. These folds increase surface area for ATP- generating chemical reactions.",
      "question": "What are the two membranes of mitochondria?"

    {
      "context": "The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules.",
      "question": "How do mitochondria release energy?"
