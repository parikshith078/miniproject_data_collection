      "context": "Some species, like snails, can change their sex, showing that sex determination can vary and is not necessarily genetic. However, humans rely predominantly on genetic factors.",

      "context": "While many species have varied methods for sex determination, in humans, the sex is largely determined by genetic factors, with specific chromosomes playing a key role.",

      "context": "The idea that the two sexes participating in sexual reproduction must be somewhat different is crucial. This difference is significant for many reasons related to survival and reproduction.",
