      "context": "Organisms look similar because their body designs are similar. If body designs are to be similar, the blueprints for these designs should be similar. Thus, reproduction at its most basic level will involve making copies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance of features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA.",
      "question": "What carries inherited features in cells?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information source for making proteins. If the information is changed, different proteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered body designs. Therefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA copy.",
      "question": "What is essential for making proteins in cells?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This creates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to be separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the original cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular structure for maintaining life processes.",
      "question": "How do cells create copies of DNA?"
    },
    {
      "context": "DNA copying is accompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and then the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus. Effectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells. These two cells are of course similar, but are they likely to be absolutely identical?",
      "question": "What process occurs when a cell divides?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The answer to this question will depend on how accurately the copying reactions involved occur. No biochemical reaction is absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process of copying the DNA will have some variations each time.",
      "question": "What affects the accuracy of DNA copying?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA copy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn cell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other variations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic outcome.",
      "question": "What can happen to drastic variations in DNA copies?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Thus, the surviving cells are similar to but subtly different from each other. This inbuilt tendency for variation during reproduction is the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter.",
      "question": "Why are surviving cells not completely identical?"
