Foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break complex substances into simpler substances.",

      "context": "These enzymes are made by RER. Lysosomes are able to break complex substances into simpler substances because they contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material.",
