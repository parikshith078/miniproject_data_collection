      "context": "Cellular respiration is a process where cells break down glucose and harness energy, resulting in the production of ATP. ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, acts as the primary energy carrier within the cells, facilitating various biochemical reactions necessary for life.",
      "question": "What is the role of ATP in cells?"
    },
    {
      "context": "During cellular respiration, glucose is converted into energy through a series of enzymatic reactions. The energy released in these reactions is captured and stored in the form of ATP, which is critical for processes like muscle contraction and protein synthesis.",
      "question": "How is ATP generated during cellular respiration?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The process of cellular respiration can be divided into several stages, including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Each stage plays a vital role in releasing energy that is ultimately stored as ATP, which the cell utilizes for various activities.",
      "question": "What are the stages of cellular respiration?"
    },
    {
      "context": "ATP is not just a product of cellular respiration; it is central to all cellular activities. The energy from ATP is used for processes like active transport, cell division, and metabolic reactions, making it an essential molecule for cell functioning.",
      "question": "Why is ATP considered crucial for cell activities?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Cells depend on ATP to perform vital functions such as movement, biosynthesis, and signaling. The synthesis of ATP occurs primarily in the mitochondria during cellular respiration, an aerobic process that significantly increases the energy available to the cell.",
      "question": "Where is ATP mainly synthesized in cells?"
