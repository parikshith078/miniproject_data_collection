      "context": "In animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and muscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hot object is an urgent and dangerous situation for us. We need to detect it, and respond to it. How do we detect that we are touching a hot object?",
      "question": "What provides control and coordination in animals?"

    {
      "context": "All information from our environment is detected by the specialised tips of some nerve cells. These receptors are usually located in our sense organs, such as the inner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so on.",
      "question": "Where are sensory receptors usually located?"
    },
    {
      "context": "This information, acquired at the end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell sets off a chemical reaction that creates an electrical impulse. This impulse travels from the dendrite to the cell body, and then along the axon to its end.",
      "question": "What triggers the creation of an electrical impulse?"
    },
    {
      "context": "At the end of the axon, the electrical impulse sets off the release of some chemicals. These chemicals cross the gap, or synapse, and start a similar electrical impulse in a dendrite of the next neuron.",
      "question": "What happens at the synapse between neurons?"
    },
    {
      "context": "This is a general scheme of how nervous impulses travel in the body. A similar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to other cells, such as muscles cells or gland.",
      "question": "What is the purpose of a synapse in the nervous system?"
    },
    {
      "context": "It is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised network of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting information via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.",
      "question": "What makes nervous tissue specialized for information conduction?"
