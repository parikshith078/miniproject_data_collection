      "context": "Many non-biodegradable substances like plastic can last for hundreds of years in the environment. Items such as plastic bags may take up to 10-20 years to decompose, while plastic bottles can last for up to 450 years. Styrofoam can persist for over a million years, posing a significant threat to wildlife and ecosystems.",
