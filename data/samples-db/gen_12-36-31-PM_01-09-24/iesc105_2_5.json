      "context": "In cell division, mitosis occurs for growth and tissue repair, generating two identical daughter cells. In contrast, meiosis produces four gametes with half the chromosomes of the mother cell.",

    },
    {
      "context": "Mitosis results in daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the mother cell. Conversely, meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in four new cells.",
      "question": "What is the outcome of meiosis?"

    {
      "context": "The mother cell divides through mitosis, producing two identical daughter cells essential for tissue repair. Gametes are produced through meiosis, which is crucial for reproduction.",
