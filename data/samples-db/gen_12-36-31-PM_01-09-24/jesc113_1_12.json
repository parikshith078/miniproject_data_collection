      "context": "In waste management, various materials decompose at different rates. Organic materials such as food scraps and yard waste typically decompose quickly due to microbial activity. Plastics, on the other hand, can take hundreds of years to break down. This difference in decomposition rates is essential for effective waste management practices.",
      "question": "Which materials decompose the fastest?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Different types of waste materials exhibit varying rates of decomposition. For instance, paper products often break down within weeks or months, while metals can take decades. Understanding which materials break down more rapidly is crucial for designing effective composting and recycling systems.",
      "question": "What type of waste changes its state fastest?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Organic waste, such as fruits and vegetables, tends to break down swiftly, aided by microorganisms. Other materials, including glass and certain plastics, remain unchanged for extended periods. Knowing these rates helps in improving composting practices and landfill management.",
      "question": "Which waste types decompose quickly?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Waste is categorized based on its decomposition speed. Biodegradable materials, like food waste and garden clippings, break down rapidly, whereas synthetic materials, like plastics, persist for years. This understanding is vital for environmental sustainability in waste management.",
      "question": "What is the fastest-changing type of waste?"
    },
    {
      "context": "In the realm of waste management, it's understood that organic wastes, including kitchen scraps and yard waste, change faster due to biological processes. Meanwhile, non-biodegradable materials remain largely intact. This knowledge is critical for promoting recycling and composting initiatives.",
      "question": "How quickly do organic materials break down?"
