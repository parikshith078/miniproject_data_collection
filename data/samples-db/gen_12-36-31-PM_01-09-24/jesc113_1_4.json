      "context": "Ozone is a gas composed of three oxygen atoms, existing naturally in the Earth's stratosphere. It forms a layer that protects living organisms by absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. The depletion of the ozone layer leads to increased UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface, which can harm plants, animals, and humans, disrupting ecosystems and food chains.",
      "question": "What is the role of ozone in ecosystems?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Ozone depletion is mainly caused by human-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). When CFCs reach the stratosphere, they are broken down by UV radiation, releasing chlorine atoms that catalyze the destruction of ozone molecules. This process results in thinning of the ozone layer, leading to more UV radiation that can have various negative effects on biological systems.",
      "question": "What causes the depletion of ozone?"

    {
      "context": "The effects of ozone depletion are significant, as increased UV radiation can cause various problems, including skin cancer in humans, harm to aquatic ecosystems by affecting phytoplankton, which are essential for the marine food web. Additionally, UV rays can damage crops and hinder plant growth, impacting food supply and biodiversity.",
      "question": "What impacts does increased UV radiation have?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Preventing further ozone layer depletion requires global cooperation through treaties such as the Montreal Protocol, which aims to phase out the use of substances harmful to the ozone layer. The agreement has been successful in reducing CFC emissions, leading to signs of recovery for the ozone layer. However, continued vigilance and adherence to these regulations are crucial.",
      "question": "How can we prevent ozone layer depletion?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Increased UV radiation due to ozone layer depletion can lead to genetic mutations and reduced reproductive rates in animal populations. For instance, UV radiation can affect the development of amphibian eggs, leading to decreased survival rates. Such changes can shift the balance of ecosystems and threaten biodiversity.",
      "question": "How does UV radiation affect animal populations?"
