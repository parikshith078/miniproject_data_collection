      "context": "Hydra reproduces through budding, where a bud forms as an outgrowth from the parent. Once mature, these buds detach and become independent.",

      "context": "In the process of budding, Hydra experiences repeated cell division leading to the formation of a bud. This bud eventually grows into a mature individual.",

      "context": "During budding in Hydra, a bud forms due to repeated cell division at a specific location on the parent organism, leading to the creation of new individuals.",
