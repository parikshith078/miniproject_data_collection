      "context": "Blood pressure is the force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel. This pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the artery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure in the artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure.",
      "question": "What is systolic pressure?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The normal systolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg. High blood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of arterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow.",
