      "context": "The substances which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of plants are called manure and fertilisers. Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the crop plants. These nutrients are essential for the growth of plants.",

      "context": "Therefore, farmers have to add manure to the fields to replenish the soil with nutrients. This process is called manuring. Improper or insufficient manuring results in weak plants.",
      "question": "What happens if manuring is insufficient?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Manure is an organic substance obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump plant and animal waste in pits at open places and allow it to decompose.",
      "question": "How is organic manure created?"

      "context": "Fertilisers are chemicals which are rich in a particular nutrient. How are they different from manure? Fertilisers are produced in factories.",

    {
      "context": "The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops such as wheat, paddy and maize. But excessive use of fertilisers has made the soil less fertile.",
      "question": "What is a downside of using too many fertilisers?"

      "context": "The use of manure improves soil texture as well as its water retaining capacity. It replenishes the soil with nutrients.",

      "context": "Another method of replenishing the soil with nutrients is through crop rotation. This can be done by growing different crops alternately.",
