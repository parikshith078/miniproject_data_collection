      "context": "Plastics can be recycled through mechanical and chemical processes. In mechanical recycling, plastics are shredded, cleaned, and melted down to make new products. Chemical recycling breaks down plastics into their original monomers for reuse. Both methods aim to reduce waste by preventing plastics from ending up in landfills or oceans.",
      "question": "What are the two main types of plastic recycling?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Recycling plastics can greatly help reduce landfill waste and resource consumption. However, the process can also cause environmental impacts, such as energy consumption, pollution from facilities, and potential loss of material quality over time, which necessitates careful management.",
      "question": "Does plastic recycling have environmental benefits?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Plastic waste often leads to environmental pollution and harms wildlife. By recycling plastic, we can create a circular economy, reduce the need for new materials, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This approach helps mitigate the negative impacts associated with plastic disposal.",
      "question": "What is a benefit of recycling plastics on wildlife?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Recycling processes can consume a substantial amount of energy and may produce emissions. Therefore, it's essential to balance the advantages of recycling with potential environmental drawbacks, such as pollutants generated during the process and the energy used in transportation and processing.",
      "question": "What is a potential downside of recycling plastics?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Plastics are categorized by resin identification codes which inform the recycling process. Sorting plastics by type is crucial as different types require specific recycling methods. This categorization plays a pivotal role in the efficiency and effectiveness of recycling operations.",
      "question": "Why is sorting plastics important in recycling?"
