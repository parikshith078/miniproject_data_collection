      "context": "The plasma membrane is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment. It allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell, and prevents movement of some other materials, which is why it is called a selectively permeable membrane.",

      "context": "Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion. Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region where its concentration is low.",
