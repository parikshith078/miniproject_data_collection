      "context": "The supply of water to crops at regular intervals is called irrigation. The time and frequency of irrigation varies from crop to crop, soil to soil and season to season. In summer, the frequency of watering is higher. Why is it so? Could it be due to the increased rate of evaporation of water from the soil and the leaves?",
      "question": "What factors affect irrigation frequency?"

      "context": "Sources of irrigation: The sources of water for irrigation areâ€” wells, tubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams and canals. Traditional Methods of Irrigation The water available in wells, lakes and canals is lifted up by different methods in different regions, for taking it to the fields.",
