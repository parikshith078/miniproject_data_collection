      "context": "Most human chromosomes have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22 such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is odd in not always being a perfect pair.",

      "context": "If that is the case, how can genetic inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human chromosomes are not paired.",
