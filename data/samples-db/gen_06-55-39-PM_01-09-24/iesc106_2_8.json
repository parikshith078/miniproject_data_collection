      "context": "The skin is composed of multiple tissue types, primarily epithelium and connective tissues, which provide protection and support. The bark of a tree is mostly composed of cork tissue, serving protective functions. Bone is a type of connective tissue that provides structure and support. The lining of kidney tubules consists of simple cuboidal epithelium, which plays a role in absorption and secretion. Vascular bundles are made up of xylem and phloem tissues responsible for transporting water, nutrients, and sugars.",

      "context": "Stomata are tiny openings on plant leaves that facilitate gas exchange. They allow for the intake of carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis while permitting the release of oxygen. Additionally, stomata play a crucial role in transpiration, which helps regulate water loss in plants. This regulation of water helps maintain overall plant health and control of internal temperature.",
