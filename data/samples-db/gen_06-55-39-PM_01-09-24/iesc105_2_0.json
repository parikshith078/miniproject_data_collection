      "context": "The Golgi apparatus consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles arranged in stacks called cisterns. These membranes often have connections with the membranes of ER and constitute a portion of a complex cellular membrane system.",

      "context": "The Golgi apparatus functions include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus.",

      "context": "Lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes made by the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). They help to keep the cell clean by digesting foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles.",
      "question": "What role do lysosomes play in the cell?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Lysosomes contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material. They can digest foreign materials and can burst to digest their own cell when damaged.",
      "question": "Why are lysosomes referred to as 'suicide bags'?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The material synthesized near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus, which is involved in the formation of lysosomes.",
      "question": "How does the Golgi apparatus contribute to lysosome formation?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Lysosomes digest foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, breaking complex substances into simpler substances using their enzymes.",
