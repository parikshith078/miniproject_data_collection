Kidneys are located in the abdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine produced in the kidneys passes through the ureters into the urinary bladder where it is stored until released through the urethra.",

This device contains a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining suspended in a tank filled with dialysing fluid, which removes waste products from the blood via diffusion, allowing for purification before the blood is pumped back into the body.",
