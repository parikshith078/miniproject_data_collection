      "context": "Blood pressure is the force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel. This pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the artery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure in the artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure.",
      "question": "What is systolic pressure?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The normal systolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg. High blood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of arterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow.",
      "question": "What is normal diastolic pressure?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Arteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various organs of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high pressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls.",
      "question": "What do arteries carry from the heart?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Veins collect the blood from different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need thick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure; instead they have valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.",
      "question": "What is the function of veins?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called capillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding cells takes place across this thin wall.",
      "question": "What are capillaries known for?"
