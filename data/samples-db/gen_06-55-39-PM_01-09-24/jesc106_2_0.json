      "context": "Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different parts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it acts include the heart.",

      "context": "As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in supply of more oxygen to our muscles.",
      "question": "What effect does adrenaline have on the heart?"

      "context": "The blood to the digestive system and skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries in these organs.",
      "question": "How does adrenaline affect blood flow to the digestive system?"
    },

      "context": "The breathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the diaphragm and the rib muscles.",
      "question": "What happens to the breathing rate when adrenaline is released?"
