      "context": "Lymph is another type of fluid involved in transportation. Through the pores present in the walls of capillaries, some amount of plasma, proteins, and blood cells escape into intercellular spaces in the tissues to form tissue fluid or lymph.",

      "context": "Lymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the intercellular spaces, which join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins. Lymph carries digested and absorbed fat from the intestine and drains excess fluid from extracellular space back into the blood.",
