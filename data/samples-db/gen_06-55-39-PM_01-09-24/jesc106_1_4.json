      "context": "When we touch the leaves of a chhui-mui (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa family), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the root goes down, the stem comes up into the air.",

      "context": "The plants also use electrical-chemical means to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals, there is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.",

      "context": "Firstly, the leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch. There is no growth involved in this movement.",
