      "context": "Photosynthesis fulfills the carbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism. It is the process by which autotrophs take in substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of energy.",
      "question": "What is the role of photosynthesis in autotrophs?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Autotrophs take in carbon dioxide and water, which are converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.",
