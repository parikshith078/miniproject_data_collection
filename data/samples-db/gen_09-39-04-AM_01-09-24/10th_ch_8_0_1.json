      "context": "The rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to the fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal amounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can be influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA.",
      "question": "What do both parents contribute equally?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Mendel worked out the main rules of such inheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from more than a century ago. Mendel's experiments test this by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall plants to reproduce by self-pollination.",
      "question": "Who formulated the rules of inheritance?"
    },
    {
      "context": "However, the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them are short. This indicates that both the tallness and shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but only the tallness trait was expressed.",
      "question": "What fraction of F2 progeny are short?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Thus, for each trait, there will be two versions in each child. Mendel proposed that two copies of factor (now called genes) controlling traits are present in sexually reproducing organisms.",
      "question": "What are controlling traits called according to Mendel?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Traits like ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are called recessive traits. Mendel’s experiments show inheritance patterns in plants allowing insights into genetics.",
      "question": "What are dominant and recessive traits?"
