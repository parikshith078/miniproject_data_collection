      "context": "Fertilization happens after pollination. A mature pollen consists of two cells. The larger one is the vegetative cell and the smaller one is the generative cell.",
      "question": "What are the two cells in mature pollen?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The vegetative cell starts growing and emerges through the germination pore, developing into a pollen tube. The generative cell divides into two male gametes (sperms).",
      "question": "What does the vegetative cell develop into?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The pollen tube enters into the embryo sac through micropyle. The pollen tube bursts open, gametes are released from the pollen tube and enter the embryo sac.",
      "question": "How does the pollen tube interact with the embryo sac?"
    },
    {
      "context": "One of the gametes fuses with the egg, and the other fuses with the secondary nucleus. The fusion of a male gamete with the egg is known as fertilization.",
      "question": "What is fertilization in plant reproduction?"
