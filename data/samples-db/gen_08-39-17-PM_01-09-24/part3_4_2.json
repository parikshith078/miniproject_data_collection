The central nervous system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything else. The brain is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord is contained within the vertebral cavity of the vertebral column.",
      "question": "What are the two major regions of the nervous system?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The peripheral nervous system is so named because it is on the periphery —meaning beyond the brain and spinal cord. Depending on different aspects of the nervous system, the dividing line between central and peripheral is not necessarily universal.",
      "question": "Why is the peripheral nervous system named as such?"

      "context": "The somatic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for conscious perception and voluntary motor responses. Voluntary motor response means the contraction of skeletal muscle, but those contractions are not always voluntary in the sense that you have to want to perform them.",
      "question": "What does the somatic nervous system control?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Some somatic motor responses are reflexes, and often happen without a conscious decision to perform them. If your friend jumps out from behind a corner and yells “Boo!” you will be startled and you might scream or leap back.",
      "question": "Give an example of a somatic reflex."
