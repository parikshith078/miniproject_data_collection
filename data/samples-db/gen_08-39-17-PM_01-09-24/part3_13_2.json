      "context": "Coliform bacteria are relatively simple to identify, are present in much larger numbers than more dangerous pathogens, and react to the natural environment and treatment processes similarly to pathogens.",

      "context": "Industries contribute chemical effluents to the Gangaâ€™s pollution load and the toxicity kills fish in large sections of the river.",
