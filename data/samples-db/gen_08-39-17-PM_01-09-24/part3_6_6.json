      "context": "Movement in sensitive plants occurs in response to touch, while movement in human legs is voluntary. This voluntary movement is controlled by signals passed to the brain.",
      "question": "What type of movement is seen in human legs?"
    },
    {
      "context": "In sensitive plants like Mimosa pudica, movements occur when stimulated by touch. These movements differ from human leg movements which are voluntary actions.",
      "question": "What stimulates movement in sensitive plants?"

      "context": "Information in the nervous system is conveyed as electrical impulses, while in hormonal systems, it is conveyed via chemical messengers traveling through blood.",
      "question": "How is information conveyed in hormonal systems?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Human leg movements involve signals being passed to the brain and are consciously controlled. In contrast, sensitive plant movements do not involve the brain.",
      "question": "What controls movement in human legs?"

    {
      "context": "Following a stimulus, the information for sensitive plant movement is transmitted by electro-chemical signals, unlike the specialized conduction tissues in animals.",
      "question": "How is information transmitted in sensitive plants?"

      "context": "The nervous system conveys information through electric impulses for rapid responses, while hormonal systems are slower and have prolonged effects.",
