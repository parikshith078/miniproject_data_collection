      "context": "Muscle tissues have special filaments; called actin and myosin. When a muscle receives a nerve signal; a series of events is triggered in the muscle. Calcium ions enter the muscle cells. It results in actin and myosin filaments sliding towards each other and that is how a muscle contracts.",

      "context": "The brain is covered by a three layered system of membranes; called meninges. Cerebrospinal fluid is filled between the meninges. The CSF provides cushion to the brain against mechanical shocks.",

      "context": "Human brain is a highly complex organ; which is mainly composed of the nervous tissue. The tissues are highly folded to accommodate a larger surface area in less space.",
