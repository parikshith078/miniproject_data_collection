      "context": "Aerobic respiration happens in the presence of oxygen and releases energy. Pyruvic acid is converted into carbon dioxide and water molecules are formed in this process.",

    {
      "context": "Anaerobic respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen, where pyruvic acid is converted into either ethyl alcohol or lactic acid.",
      "question": "What do pyruvic acid convert into during anaerobic respiration?"

      "context": "When running fast, pain in leg muscles occurs due to anaerobic respiration, resulting in lactic acid formation.",
      "question": "What causes pain in leg muscles during running?"
    },
    {
      "context": "In anaerobic respiration of muscle cells, lactic acid is formed, which leads to muscle pain after intense exercise.",
      "question": "What substance causes muscle pain after intense exercise?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Muscles compensate for energy demands with anaerobic respiration, leading to a buildup of lactic acid during intense activity.",
      "question": "How do muscles meet increased energy demands?"
