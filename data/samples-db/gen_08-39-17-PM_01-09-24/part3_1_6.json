      "context": "Autotrophic nutrition is characterized by organisms that can synthesize their own food using light or chemical energy, allowing them to be independent of other food sources. This is essential for ecosystems as they provide energy for heterotrophic organisms.",

      "context": "Heterotrophic nutrition includes various organisms, primarily animals and fungi, that rely on consuming other living or dead organic matter to obtain their energy. This nutritional method plays a vital role in nutrient cycling within ecosystems.",
