      "context": "Plant tissues are of two main types, viz. meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Meristematic tissue is located only at specific regions which enables plant growth. Meristematic tissues consist of similar and immature cells that can divide forming new cells. This continuous division helps in increasing the plant's length and thickness.",

      "context": "Meristematic tissues are made up of group of similar and immature cells, which can divide and form new cells. Depending upon the position, meristematic tissues are of three types: i) Apical meristems, ii) Intercalary meristems, and iii) Lateral meristems. Each type serves a specific growth function in plants.",

      "context": "Apical meristem is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the plant body. Intercalary meristems help in elongation of the internodes at the base of leaves and in monocotyledonous plants. Lateral meristems increase the width of the plant body.",
