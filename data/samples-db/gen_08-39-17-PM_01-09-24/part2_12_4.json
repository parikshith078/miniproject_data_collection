      "question": "What are the main nutrients supplied by fertilizers?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Excessive use of fertilizer leads to pollution of water. Continuous use of fertilizer leads to a decrease in soil fertility because the organic matter of the soil cannot be replenished as microorganisms present in soil get harmed due to fertilizer.",
