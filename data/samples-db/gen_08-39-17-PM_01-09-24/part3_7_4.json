      "context": "Multicellular organisms cannot reproduce by cell division because they are not simple random collections of cells, but rather organized into specialized tissues and organs. This organization makes cell-by-cell division impractical for these organisms.",

      "context": "Complex multicellular organisms lack the specialized tissues that simple organisms possess, which have the potential to regenerate and grow into a new organism, making reproduction more complex in these larger systems.",
