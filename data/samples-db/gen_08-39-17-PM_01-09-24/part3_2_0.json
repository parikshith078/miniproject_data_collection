      "context": "The human excretory system is composed of a pair of kidneys. A tube; called ureter; comes out of each kidney and goes to the urinary bladder. Urine is collected in the urinary bladder, from where it is expelled out through urethra as and when required.",
      "question": "What are the main components of the excretory system?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Nephron is called the functional unit of kidney. It is composed of a tangled mess of tubes and a filtering part; called glomerulus.",
      "question": "What is the functional unit of the kidney?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Filtration happens because of very high pressure inside the glomerulus. The lumen of efferent arteriole is smaller than that of afferent arteriole.",
      "question": "Why does high pressure cause filtration in glomerulus?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The filtered blood is sent to the systemic circulation through efferent arteriole and the filtrate goes to the Bowmanâ€™s capsule. That is how urine is formed inside the kidneys.",
      "question": "Where does the filtered blood go after glomerulus?"
    },
    {
      "context": "In the proximal tubule, some substances such as amino acids, glucose, and salts are selectively reabsorbed and unwanted molecules are added in the urine.",
      "question": "What substances are selectively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Removal of harmful waste from the body is called excretion. Many wastes are produced during various metabolic activities.",
      "question": "What is the definition of excretion?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The urine formed in each kidney enters a long tube called ureter. From ureter, it gets transported to the urinary bladder and then into the urethra.",
      "question": "What is the pathway of urine after kidney formation?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Nephrons are the basic filtering units of kidneys. Each kidney possesses large number of nephrons, approximately 1 -1.5 million.",
      "question": "How many nephrons are approximately in each kidney?"

    {
      "context": "The glomerulus is a network of blood capillaries to which renal artery is attached. The artery which takes blood to the glomerulus is called afferent arteriole.",
      "question": "What is the purpose of the afferent arteriole?"
