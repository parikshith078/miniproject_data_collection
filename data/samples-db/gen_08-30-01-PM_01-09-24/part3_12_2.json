      "context": "The energy enters the plants (from the sun) through photosynthesis during the making of food. This energy is then passed on from one organism to another in a food chain.",

    },

      "context": "Energy given out by the organisms as heat is lost to the environment; it does not return to be used by the plants again. This makes the flow of energy in ecosystem 'unidirectional'.",
      "question": "Why is energy flow considered unidirectional?"

    {
      "context": "The energy available at each successive trophic level is 10 percent of the previous level. Thus, there is a progressive decline (gradual reduction) in the amount of energy available as we go from producer level to the higher trophic levels of organisms.",
      "question": "What percentage of energy is available at higher trophic levels?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Thus, the flow of energy in the ecosystem is said to be unidirectional because the energy lost as heat from the living organisms of a food chain cannot be reused by plants in photosynthesis.",
      "question": "Why can't the energy lost by organisms be reused?"
