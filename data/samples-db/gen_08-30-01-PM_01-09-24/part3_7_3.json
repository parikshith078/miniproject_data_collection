      "context": "Binary fission results in two daughter cells, while multiple fission leads to several daughter cells being formed from a single parent cell. The former is more common in favorable environments while the latter is a survival strategy.",

      "context": "Organisms like Amoeba and Paramecium reproduce through binary fission, where one parent organism divides into two. This method is efficient and rapid under suitable conditions, promoting quick population growth.",

      "context": "Multiple fission is a reproductive strategy used by certain organisms like Plasmodium, allowing them to survive in hostile conditions by producing numerous offspring at once when needed.",
