      "context": "During the incubation of 3 to 25 days in tetanus, the bacterium generates a strong exotoxin called tetanospasmin. This toxin is carried by blood to the central nervous system where it triggers muscle spasms.",

    {
      "context": "The incubation period associated with tetanus can be anywhere from 3 to 25 days, as the pathogenic bacterium releases tetanospasmin, which is carried by the blood into the central nervous system, causing convulsions in muscles.",
      "question": "What is transported to the central nervous system during tetanus?"
