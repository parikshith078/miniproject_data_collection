      "context": "Chronic respiratory diseases can take various forms, with chronic obstructive respiratory disease being one of them. It results from irreversible obstruction of the larger airways in the lung, impacting airflow.",

      "context": "The lung diseases may appear in different forms, with asthma representing a reversible type of obstruction affecting the smaller airways, unlike chronic obstructive respiratory disease, which is irreversible.",

    {
      "context": "Chronic obstructive respiratory disease is related to irreversible airway obstruction, while asthma involves airway obstruction that can be reversed. Both are significant chronic respiratory conditions.",
      "question": "Are the obstructive conditions of asthma reversible?"

    {
      "context": "Chronic respiratory diseases include conditions that affect lung function. Asthma causes reversible airway obstruction, contrasting with chronic obstructive respiratory disease's irreversible nature.",
      "question": "What type of airway obstruction does asthma cause?"
