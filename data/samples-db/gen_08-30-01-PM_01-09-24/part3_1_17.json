      "context": "The human respiratory system is composed of a pair of lungs. These are attached to a system of tubes which open on the outside through the nostrils. Following are the main structures in the human respiratory system: Nostrils: There two nostrils which converge to form a nasal passage.",
      "question": "What do the nostrils help to filter?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The mucus and the hairs help in filtering the dust particles out from inhaled air. Further, air is warmed up when it enters the nasal passage.",

      "context": "Cartilaginous rings prevent the collapse of trachea in the absence of air. Bronchi: A pair of bronchi comes out from the trachea; with one bronchus going to each lung.",

      "context": "This is alveolus; where oxygen mixes with the blood and carbon dioxide exits from the blood. The exchange of gases; in alveoli; takes place due to pressure differential.",
