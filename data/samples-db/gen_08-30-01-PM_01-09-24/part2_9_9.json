      "context": "The oxygen cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. Photosynthesis is a key process that contributes to this cycle, essential for sustaining life. It is the largest contributor to the oxygen present in the atmosphere.",
      "question": "What is the main driving factor of the oxygen cycle?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Photosynthesis plays a critical role in the oxygen cycle as it produces oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. This process occurs primarily in plants, algae, and some bacteria, helping to replenish atmospheric oxygen levels and support life.",
      "question": "Which process is responsible for producing oxygen?"
