    {
      "context": "This happens because of a higher rate of cell division in the part of stem which is away from the sunlight.",

      "context": "If a plant is kept in a container in which no sunlight reaches and a hole in the container allows some sunlight; the stem finally grows in the direction of the sunlight.",
