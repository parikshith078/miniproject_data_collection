      "context": "Depending upon the position, meristematic tissues are of three types: i) Apical meristems: Apical meristem is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the plant body.",

      "context": "These meristems occupy base of the leaves and the base of the internodal regions in plants such as grasses (mostly in monocotyledonous plants). These help in elongation of the internodes.",
