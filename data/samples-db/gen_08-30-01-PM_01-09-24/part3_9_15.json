      "context": "Miller and Urey conducted the Miller -Urey experiment in 1953 to demonstrate how the life would have originated on the earth. They created an environment in laboratory which mimicked the environment of earth as it was during the time of origin of life.",
      "question": "What year was the Miller-Urey experiment conducted?"
