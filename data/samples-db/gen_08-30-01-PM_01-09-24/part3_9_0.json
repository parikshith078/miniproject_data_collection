      "context": "Mendel's experiments with pea plants showed that round and yellow seeds are dominant traits. The F2 generation from self-pollinated F1 plants exhibited a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, indicating the presence of both dominant and recessive traits.",

      "context": "In Mendel's experiments, the F2 generation produced round yellow seeds, round green seeds, wrinkled yellow seeds, and wrinkled green seeds. The dominant traits were round and yellow, while wrinkled and green were recessive.",

      "context": "Mendel's observations of the F2 generation revealed that out of every 16 offspring, the phenotypes appeared in the ratio 9 round yellow, 3 round green, 3 wrinkled yellow, and 1 wrinkled green seed.",
      "question": "How many phenotypes did Mendel identify in the F2 generation?"

      "context": "When self-pollinated, the F1 generation produced various combinations of seed traits in the F2 generation, confirming Mendelâ€™s laws of inheritance with a 9:3:3:1 distribution.",
      "question": "What does the 9:3:3:1 ratio represent in Mendel's study?"

      "context": "Mendel's research indicated that round and yellow seed traits are dominant, whereas wrinkled texture and green color were found to be recessive when plants self-pollinated.",
      "question": "Which seed traits were found to be recessive in Mendel's experiments?"
