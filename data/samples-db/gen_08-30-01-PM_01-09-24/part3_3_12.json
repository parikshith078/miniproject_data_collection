      "context": "A nerve cell is a microscopic structure consisting of three major parts namely cell body, dendrites and axon. Cell Body: It is the cell structure irregular in shape or polyhedral structure, it is also called as cyton. Cell body contains cytoplasm with typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called Nissl granules.",
      "question": "What is another name for the cell body?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Dendrites or Dendrons are shorter fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body. Dendrites transmit electrical impulses towards the cyton.",
      "question": "What do dendrites transmit towards the cyton?"
    },
    {
      "context": "One of the fibres arising from the cell body is very long with a branched distal end and it is called as Axon. The distal branches terminate as bulb-like structures called synaptic knob filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters.",
      "question": "What are the bulb-like structures at the end of axons called?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Axon contains axoplasm inside and is covered by a membrane called neurilemma. Neurilemma encloses the axon except at the branched distal ends. In some neurons called myelinated neurons an additional white fatty fibre called myelin sheath covers the neurilemma.",
      "question": "What covers the axon in myelinated neurons?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The gaps left by the myelin sheath on the axon are called Nodes of Ranvier. Over the myelin sheath are found certain cells called Schwann cells.",
      "question": "What are the gaps in the myelin sheath called?"
