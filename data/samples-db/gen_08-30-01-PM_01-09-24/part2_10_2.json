      "context": "The oxygen in the atmosphere is freed by the process of photolysis. The energy in the sunlight breaks the oxygen bearing oxygen to produce free oxygen.",
      "question": "How does photolysis contribute to the oxygen cycle?"

      "context": "Plants and phytoplankton undergo process of photosynthesis where carbon dioxide is used in the presence of sunlight to form carbohydrates and oxygen.",
      "question": "What do plants produce during photosynthesis?"
