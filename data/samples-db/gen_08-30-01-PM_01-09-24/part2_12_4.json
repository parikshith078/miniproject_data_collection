      "context": "Application of fertilizers results in higher yield of crops but increases the cost of farming. As the fertilizers are water soluble chemicals, a large part of the fertilizers applied is washed away due to excessive irrigation, resulting in the growth of unwanted plants like Water Hyacinth, algae, etc.",
      "question": "How do fertilizers affect farming costs?"
