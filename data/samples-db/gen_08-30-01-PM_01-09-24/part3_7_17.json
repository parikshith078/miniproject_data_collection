      "context": "Fertilization happens after pollination. A mature pollen consists of two cells. The larger one is the vegetative cell and the smaller one is the generative cell. The vegetative cell starts growing and emerges through the germination pore, developing into a pollen tube.",
      "question": "What are the two types of cells in mature pollen?"
    },
    {
      "context": "The generative cell divides into two male gametes (sperms). The pollen tube enters into the embryo sac through micropyle. The pollen tube bursts open, gametes are released from the pollen tube and enter the embryo sac.",
