      "context": "For aerobic respiration; organisms need a continuous supply of oxygen, and carbon dioxide produced during the process needs to be removed from the body. Different organisms use different methods for intake of oxygen and expulsion of carbon dioxide.",
      "question": "Why do organisms require a continuous supply of oxygen?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Diffusion is the method which is utilized by unicellular and some simple organisms for this purpose. In plants also, diffusion is utilized for exchange of gases.",
      "question": "What method do unicellular organisms use for gas exchange?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Fishes take in oxygen; which is dissolved in water; through gills. Since availability of oxygen is less in the aquatic environment so the breathing rate of aquatic organisms is faster.",
      "question": "How do fish obtain oxygen from their environment?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Insects have a system of spiracles and tracheae which is used for taking in oxygen. Terrestrial organisms have developed lungs for exchange of gases.",
      "question": "What gas exchange system do insects possess?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Availability of oxygen is not a problem in the terrestrial environment so breathing rate is slower compared to what it is in fishes.",
      "question": "Why is the breathing rate slower in terrestrial organisms than in fish?"
