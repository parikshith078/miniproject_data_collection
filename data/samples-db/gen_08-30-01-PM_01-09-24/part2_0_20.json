      "context": "Phloem fibres, commonly referred to as bast-fibres, are derived from sclerenchyma tissue and play a crucial role in providing mechanical support to plants. They differ from the other three types of phloem cells because they are composed of dead tissues, aiding in the structural integrity of the plant.",

      "context": "Phloem fibres, also known as bast-fibres, belong to the class of sclerenchyma cells and are important for their role in supporting the plant structurally. They are unique compared to the other phloem cells because they do not have living tissues.",
