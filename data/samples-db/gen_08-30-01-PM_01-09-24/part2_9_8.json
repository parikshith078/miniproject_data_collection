      "context": "Greenhouse gases, which include water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane, warm the atmosphere by efficiently absorbing thermal infrared radiation emitted by the earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds.",

      "context": "As a result of its warmth, the atmosphere also radiates thermal infrared in all directions, including downward to the Earth’s surface.",
      "question": "How does the atmosphere radiate thermal infrared?"
