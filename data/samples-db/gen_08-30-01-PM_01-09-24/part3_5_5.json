      "context": "The movement of leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica is independent of growth. A different process is phototropism, which involves growth towards light.",
      "question": "What triggers the movement in Mimosa pudica?"

      "context": "Phototropism is a type of movement that is directional and dependent on growth. It causes plant shoots to grow towards light, which is beneficial for photosynthesis.",
      "question": "How does phototropism benefit plants?"
    },
    {
      "context": "Mimosa pudica exhibits movements in response to touch, showcasing a unique adaptation. In contrast, phototropism illustrates how plants grow towards environmental stimuli.",
      "question": "What is the difference between Mimosa pudica and phototropism?"
