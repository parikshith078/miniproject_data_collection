    },
    {
      "context": "After the ingestion of food, holozoic nutrition proceeds with digestion, where food is broken down inside the body. This is crucial for the organism to derive nutrients from the ingested food before it can be absorbed by the cells.",
      "question": "What occurs after ingestion in holozoic nutrition?"
    },

    {
      "context": "In holozoic nutrition, absorption follows digestion, allowing nutrients from the digested food to enter the organism's bloodstream. This step is crucial for the nourishment and energy of the organism.",
      "question": "What happens during the absorption step?"

    {
      "context": "Egestion is the final step of holozoic nutrition, where undigested waste materials are eliminated from the organism's body. This process is essential to maintain health and to remove harmful substances.",
      "question": "What is the purpose of egestion in holozoic nutrition?"
