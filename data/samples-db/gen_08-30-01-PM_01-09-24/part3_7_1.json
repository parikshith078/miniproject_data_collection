      "context": "Unlike flowering plants, Rhizopus and Mucor reproduce by spore formation. The spore case bursts and releases spores into the air, which can land on food or soil.",

      "context": "The air-borne spores of Rhizopus, when they land on food or soil, can germinate and produce new individuals if the conditions are favourable.",

    {
      "context": "Fungi like Rhizopus, Mucor, and non-flowering plants such as ferns and mosses use spore formation as a method of reproduction.",
      "question": "Which organisms reproduce by spore formation?"

      "context": "Spore formation in Rhizopus involves the bursting of the spore case called sporangium, releasing spores to the environment.",
