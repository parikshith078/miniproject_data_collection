      "context": "The brain, spinal cord and nerves are all composed of the nervous tissue. The cells of this tissue are called nerve cells or neurons.",

      "context": "Usually, each neuron has a single long part, called the axon, and many short, branched parts called dendrites.",

      "context": "An axon is a long thread-like extension of nerve cells that transmits impulses away from the cell body. Dendrites, on the other hand, are thread-like extensions of the cell body that receive nerve impulses.",

      "context": "This coordinated function helps in transmitting impulses very quickly.",
