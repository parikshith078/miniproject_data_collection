      "context": "Studies on eye color have shown a correlation between children's eye color and that of their parents. This suggests a possible genetic basis for eye color inheritance but doesn't clearly indicate if the trait is dominant or recessive.",
      "question": "Can we conclude eye color is dominant or recessive?"

      "context": "Mendelian genetics explains that both male and female parents provide genetic material at conception. This process ensures that the progeny receives a balanced genetic contribution from each parent, affecting traits in predictable ways.",
