      "context": "The F1 plants showed that tallness was expressed, indicating that it is a dominant trait. The shortness trait was inherited but not shown, categorizing it as a recessive trait.",

    {
      "context": "The F1 generation demonstrated that although both traits were inherited, only the dominant trait of tallness was visible. This illustrates the principle of dominance in genetics.",
      "question": "What does it mean when a trait is dominant?"

      "context": "In the F1 generation, the tall plants exhibit the dominant trait, while the short plants represent the recessive trait, helping to illustrate the concept of trait inheritance.",
      "question": "What happens to recessive traits in dominant trait cases?"
    },

      "context": "In this genetic observation, the tallness trait overshadowed the shortness trait, leading to a clear illustration of how dominant traits can suppress the expression of recessive traits in plant genetics.",
      "question": "How does tallness relate to shortness in this experiment?"
