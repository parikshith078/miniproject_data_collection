      "Content": "Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crops to aid their growth. Two methods of irrigation that conserve water include:\n1. Drip irrigation: This method involves delivering water directly to the base of the plant, minimizing evaporation and runoff.\n2. Sprinkler irrigation: This method uses a system of pipes and pumps to spray water like rainfall, reducing waste and runoff."
