These can make the food poisonous causing serious illness and even death. So, it is very important that we preserve food to prevent it from being spoilt."

By keeping the surroundings clean and dry we can prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Try to make a list of measures which help to avoid the spread of malaria. Vaccination to be given at suitable age. Maintain personal hygiene and good sanitary habits. Consume properly cooked food and boiled drinking water. Use mosquito net and repellents. Spray insecticides and control breeding of mosquitoes by not allowing water to collect in the surroundings."

Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are common preservatives. Preservation by Common Salt includes covering meat and fish with dry salt to check bacterial growth."

Heat treatments like boiling milk can kill many microorganisms, and cold treatments like refrigeration inhibit microbe growth. The pasteurisation process was discovered by Louis Pasteur, which heats milk to about 70°C for 15 to 30 seconds and then suddenly cools it to store it safely."
