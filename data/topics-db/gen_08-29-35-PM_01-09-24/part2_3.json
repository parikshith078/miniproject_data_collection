Those with organized nucleus are kept in other kingdoms. Number of cells: Unicellular eukaryotes are kept in the kingdom Protista, while multicellular eukaryotes are kept in other kingdoms. Mode of nutrition and presence of cell wall: Heterotrophic organisms in which cell wall is present are taken under the kingdom fungi. Autotrophic organisms in which cell wall is present are taken in the kingdom Plantae. Organisms in which cell wall is absent are taken in the kingdom Animalia."
