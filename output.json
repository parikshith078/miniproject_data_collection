      "context": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process occurs mainly in the chloroplasts of plant cells, using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce oxygen as a byproduct. The overall chemical reaction can be simplified as: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.",

      "context": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. This cycle involves processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and infiltration. Water vapor in the atmosphere condenses to form clouds and eventually falls back to the Earth as rain, snow, or sleet.",
      "question": "What are the main processes of the water cycle?"

      "context": "The cell membrane is a biological membrane that separates and protects the interior of all cells from the external environment. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that help regulate what enters and exits the cell. This selective permeability is crucial for maintaining homeostasis within the cell.",
      "question": "What functions does the cell membrane serve?"

      "context": "The theory of evolution, first formulated by Charles Darwin, proposes that species change over time through a process known as natural selection. According to this theory, organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to the next generation, leading to gradual evolution of species.",
      "question": "Who first proposed the theory of evolution?"

    {
      "context": "Atoms are the basic units of matter and the defining structure of elements. Each atom consists of a nucleus made of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons that orbit the nucleus in various energy levels. Chemical properties of an element are determined by the arrangement of these electrons.",
      "question": "What are the basic components of an atom?"
